# MapBoxExample
This is an example of integrating MapBox and using some features of it in an android app.
What you can do with the app :
- Draw a polygon on the map
- Save the polygon on a local room database (store name, address, and area of polygon)
- Choose from stored polygons shown in the spinner
- animate camera to the location when choosing a polygon
- delete a polygon from the database
- Retrieve address area of the drawn polygon
- calculate the drawn area in hectare (ha)

I used in this project:
- Kotlin
- MVVM architecture
- View binding
- Room database
- Mapbox map
